### **_Description_**

A sports-based web app to view and track all your favorite teams and players. The project will be created in seven days as part of the General Assembly SEI program to test and showcase skills using a Vue/Flask/PostgreSQL stack. Vuetify components will be used to clean up UI elements. Additionally, the API-FOOTBALL API will be used to pull in data for Leagues/Teams/Players/Stats/Standings.

### **_Technologies Used_**

- Vue.js Front-End
  - Vuetify
- Flask Back-End
  - SQLAlchemy
- PostgreSQL Database

### **_Getting Started_**

The project is deployed on Vercel/Heroku and can be viewed [here]().

1. From the Home page you can look through leages, teams, and players without an account.
2. In order to make things easier to view on return visits you can create an account with the link in the top-right portion of the page.

The Trello board that was used to plan and this project and track development can be viewed [here](https://trello.com/b/oUYkQ3iR/sportsvue).
